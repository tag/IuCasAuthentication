# IuCasAuthentication
A CAS authentication object that works with CAS @ IU. Using [CAS at IU](https://kb.iu.edu/d/atfc) isn't complicated, and UITS even provides some [sample code for PHP](https://kb.iu.edu/d/bfru). This helper class aims to make the process even easier.

Note that this library does not provide any _authorization_ (permissions based on user name), only _authentication_ (verifying a user's credentials).

Follows PSR-4 and [PSR-2][PSR2] standards. Requires PHP >= 7.1. Tested against PHP v7.1 â€“ v7.3

[PSR2]: https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan

## Installation

The preferred method of installation is with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org).

### Install with Composer
Add the following to your `composer.json` file:
```
"tag/iu-cas": ">=1.0"
```

Or, install the Composer package:
```
composer require tag/iu-cas
```

### Install without Composer

Download the `IuCasAuthentication` class, and include or require it on your page(s).

## Using `IuCasAuthentication`

1. Create a new authentication object.

   * The first is the URL authentication should redirect to. Must be the same during authentication and validation steps. Defaults to the current URL.
   * An optional second argument must be one of the [CAS application codes at IU](https://kb.iu.edu/d/alqm). Defaults to `'IU'`.
   * An optional third argument is a reference to a [PSR-3][psr3] logger (such as Monolog). Used to log remote errors, if available. Defaults to `null``.

2. Call `#authenticate()`

Although CAS expects applicaitons to only authenticate once per session, the `IuCasAuthentication` class stores a
successful authentication in `$_SESSION`, so it is safe to use on every page (or as Middleware) to test authentication.

If the username is in `$_SESSION`, `#authenticate()` considers the user successfully authenticated, and does not attempt to check against CAS.

[psr3]: https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-3/

### Simplest method
Let the `IuCasAuthentication` helper do all of the work for you. Requires `$_SESSION` to currently be writable.

This code would need to be called on every page you wish protected.

```php
<?php
// File: any.php

$casHelper = new \IuCas\IuCasAuthentication();
$casHelper->authenticate(); // Default behavior is 401 and die on failure.
                            // Pass a URL to redirect on failure instead; see documentation for other options

// Continue processing file as normal

// After authentication, user name is available
$userName = $casHelper->getUserName(); // Actually stored in $_SESSION
```

### Recommended method

Rather than relying on the built-in behavior, pass explicit [callback functions](http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.callable.php) for authentication failure or success.

The two callbacks are:

1. On Failure: Defaults to setting a `"401 Unauthorized"` header and `exit;`.
2. On Success: Defaults to setting the user name returned from CAS in session and returning.

```php
$casHelper = new \IuCas\IuCasAuthentication();

$casHelper->authenticate(
        function () {
            http_response_code(401);     // Unauthorized
            header('Location: /public'); // Failure, go to page that doesn't require authentication
            exit;
        },
        function ($username) {
            // Success, store the user
            $casHelper->setUserName($success); // Sets to $_SESSION['CAS_USER']; key may be overridden via environment
        }
    );
```

### Manage login and validation manually
Although the `#authenticate()` function does all of the work for you, it's possible to manage the authentication process manually if you wish.

```php
$casHelper = new \IuCas\IuCasAuthentication();

if (!$casHelper->getUserName()) {

    if (!$casHelper->getCasTicket()) {
        header('Location: ' . $casHelper->getCasLoginUrl(), true, 303);
        exit;
    } else {
        $result = $casHelper->validate();
        if ($result) { // Success, logged in
            $_SESSION['username'] = $result;  // Unless environment variables are set, this value will not be seen by IuCasAuthentication
        } else { // Failure
            header("HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized");
            // Add optional redirect here
            exit;
        }
    }
}

// Continue processing file as normal
```

### Example with login and validation on different pages in your app

You might use this example code to only implement CAS authentication at a specific URL. Instead of calling `#authenticate()`, you might do the following:

```php
<?php
// File: login.php

$appUrl = 'http://localhost/login-validate'; // URL CAS should redirect to with the CAS ticket after login
$casHelper = new \IuCas\IuCasAuthentication($appUrl);

header('Location: ' . $casHelper->getCasLoginUrl(), true, 303);
exit;
```

```php
<?php
// File: login-validate.php

// Remember, your application URL in validation must match the one passed in the authentication step
$appUrl = 'http://localhost/login-validate';
$casHelper = new \IuCas\IuCasAuthentication($appUrl);

$result = $casHelper->validate();

if ($result) {
    // Success, logged in
    $_SESSION['username'] = $result;
    header('Location: /', true, 303);
} else {
    // Failure; Redirect to logout to clear session
    header('Location: /logout', true, 303);
}

exit;
```


### Slim Framework example

The following code would work with the [Slim Framework](http://www.slimframework.com). This example also uses a [PSR-3][psr3] logger and anonymous callback functions. The login functionality would be better implemented as Middleware, but this example highlights some features of the `IuCasAuthentication` helper.

```php
$app->get('/login', function (Request $request, Response $response) {
    $appUrl = 'https://localhost/login-validate';
    $casHelper = new \IuCas\IuCasAuthentication($appUrl);
    
    return $response->withRedirect($casHelper->getCasLoginUrl(), 303);
});

$app->get('/login-validate', function (Request $request, Response $response) {
    
    $appUrl = 'https://localhost/login-validate'; // URL CAS has redirected to with the CAS ticket after login
                                                  // Must match the one passed to CAS in the authentication step
    $casHelper = new \IuCas\IuCasAuthentication($appUrl);
    $casHelper->setLogger($this->get('logger'));
    
    return $casHelper->authenticate(
        function () use (&$response) {
            return $response->withRedirect('/logout', 401); // Failure, go to page that doesn't require authentication
        },
        function ($username) use (&$response) {
            // Do other session-setting stuff here, if desired
            return $response->withRedirect('/home', 303); // Success, logged in
        }
    );
});

```

## Logging

You may pass an optional PSR-3 logger as the third parameter of the constructor. If the validation step fails, details are sent to the logger, if available.

## Environment variables
In most cases, it is not necessary to create environment variables to modify the default behavior of this library for use with CAS at IU. Everything should already work without additional configuration. However, if you wish to change the default behavior, several environment variables are available.

[Best practice][env-how-to] in PHP is to put important configuration options in environment variables, perhaps in your virtual host configuration (e.g., `httpd.conf` or `.htacess`) or in a `.env` file. [Several][env1] [libraries][env2] are available via Composer to assit in loading `.env` files.

[env-how-to]: https://jolicode.com/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-environment-variables-with-php
[env1]: https://packagist.org/packages/symfony/dotenv
[env2]: https://packagist.org/packages/josegonzalez/dotenv

The three necessary URLs (login, validation, logout) as described by https://kb.iu.edu/d/atfc are included by default but may be overridden through the use of the following environment variables.

* `CAS_LOGIN_URL` defaults to `'https://cas.iu.edu/cas/login'`
* `CAS_VALIDATION_URL` defaults to `'https://cas.iu.edu/cas/validate'`
* `CAS_LOGOUT_URL` defaults to `'https://cas.iu.edu/cas/logout'`

Two additional environment variables are used:

* `CAS_SESSION_VAR` defaults to `'CAS_USER'`, therefore the user name of the active user is available at
  `$_SESSION[getenv('CAS_SESSION_VAR')]`. Current value is returned by `#getSessionVar()`. The session variable is used
  by `#getUserName()` and `#setUserName()`, which in turn are used by `#logout()` and the default success handler for
  `#authenticate()` to store the user name response from CAS in `$_SESSION`.
* `CAS_TIMEOUT` Sets the timeout of service requests to CAS validation and logout services. Defaults to `5`.

If storing authentication status somewhere other than the session variable, it's probably best to use the callback variation of `#authenticate()`.

Each of these environment variable defaults is also available as a class constant. e.g., `IuCasAuthentication::CAS_VALIDATION_URL`. (Exception: Timeout constant is named `IuCasAuthentication::CAS_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`.)
